Project Description:
-Website Title: GitRipped
-Student Names: Christina, Emilio, and Phil
-This workout app allows users to search for and explore various exercises and add custom exercises.

1. Technologies Used:
MongoDb, Express, React and Tailwind


2. Approach Taken:
We began with an outline of all components in the front end and all routes in the backend. Working in our front end, we created our model and state. Then, in our back end, we created our CRUD routes (create and read), specifically, get and post, our controllers and our models. Next, we created our components and finished out routes, put and delete.

3. User Stories
-As a user, I want to browse through different exercises and view their details on a separate page
-As a user, I want to add my own custom exercises and have the option to edit or delete them from the home page
-As a user, I want to be able to view the app from my phone or on the desktop
// stretch goal user stories

-As a user, I want to be able to create my own account and make custom workouts that I can add reps/sets to and check them off during workout
-As a user, I want to be able to fully customize all workouts and have the option to edit and delete ALL exercises from the API
-As a user, I want to be able to filter all my exercises by muscle group
